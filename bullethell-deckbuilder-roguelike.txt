 - I think it makes more sense to have a single fireball rather than a machine gun that fires lots of stuff
 - you still dodge, it's still bullet hell, you just have to be more precise
 - when you cast a few spells you get tiny orbs circling your head, each one representing a future spell
	- when you start casting a certain spell its orb shifts to the center and grows bigger
	- same for enemies - THOSE ARE THEIR INTENTIONS
		- this way you can foresee their possible actions for their next "turn" and prepare appropriately


consider PACE OF PLAY: EtG/bullet hell is very fast paced, StS/turn-based cards are as slow as you want them to be
 - if this were a cover-based shooter it would have a more natural flow with stops for taking cover, reloading, going between covers, etc.
 - this means that:
	- rooms need more cover, including ways to create cover via cards
	- enemies need ways to deal with cover:
		- ways to efficiently destroy cover
		- ways to maneuver around cover
	- it also makes sense to have enemies act in "turns"
		- let's say the enemy does a large AoE each end of turn, but it also shoots bullets during the turn, so you can prepare for the AoE while dodging the bullets



ACTUALLY, WHAT IF THIS IS COMPLETELY REAL-TIME? @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
 - the pace of combat naturally slows down periodically, and you'll need to learn when it's safe
 - you cast spells, summon allies, conjure weapons, etc., as well as draw your hand, in real time
	- use either mouse or keyboard numbers to use cards

 - if it's completely real-time you can lean into the slowness, make the fight alternate between fast and hectic dodging and slower, deliberate attacks
 
 - if it's real-time you can have rituals that require several card casts in sequence, performed while you're using defenses from other cards



THEMATIC CHALLENGE: magic should be organic
 - think about how much more you liked Naruto's naturalistic approach over classic fantasy
	- breathing fire through your mouth is much better than throwing a magical fire grenade
		- maybe your head morphs into a dragon head and you breathe fire
	- so, summons don't appear above magic circles, summons are spewed from coffins that burst through the ground, for example
	
	- magic should be naturalistic, or monstrous
	
	- I think Avatar is also very good at this approach



YOU CARD-DRAW AND PLAY INSTEAD OF RELOADING
 - you choose the "reload" timing carefully
 - after reloading you get weapons and/or items to use
	- you want to set up combos with strong weapons that match the current level, boss range, etc.
 - then you play the "round" with the weapons and items you got, maneuvering, dodging and firing


an actual reload card (that reloads one of the last weapons used) seems reasonable

a parry card (for projectiles, not beams or AoEs)

MAKE CRITICAL AREAS for enemies and bosses, i.e. headshots

card-based roguelike bullet hell, AKA Enter The Gungeon meets Slay the Spire?

you can slow down/pause the game to play a card (and if you slow down you MUST play a card or draw another hand)

drawing a hand of cards takes time (an animation)

good opportunity to work with randomizable enemies/bosses/mini-bosses
 - each e/b/mb has ways to scale up, get attacks, effects
 - e/b/mb can come in duos, have minions, someone replacing them after they die
 - e/b/mb can have weird second (and maybe even third) phases

cards translate into attacks, defenses, structures, weapons, temporary buffs or debuffs
	think: barricades, turrets, traps, lures, etc.

	debuffs should be AoEs that the enemy can maneuver out of (!!)
		might be true for most debuffs and maybe some buffs too - area buffs are interesting

	some cards are instants, some require an animation, some require animation AND slow you down, or force you to stand
		obvious move: have a card that makes the next card you play an instant, or rather speeds it up by one (instant -- animation -- slow-moving animation -- standing animation)
		item that buffs slow and standing animations?
		item that buffs long-range damage?
		"last bullet in clip deals double damage" relic
		"damage buff on low HP" relic
		critical hit multiplier relic?
		
	
	there should be some energy mechanism similar to StS
		should recharge fully when you shuffle your hand
		should recharge gradually in real time
			recharge speed is a variable too
		
		initially capped at 3, can be increased, StS-style
	
	you start with 2 weapon slots, can increase/decrease with items
	
	each end of combat you lose your weapons 


what if you DO have equipment you can change?
 - you can change your deck
	- since you can draw over and over again this is VERY powerful, so probably limit this somehow
		- for example, each card replace/remove/add costs money, or you can do only a few changes...
		
 - you can change your items (and you're limited to a certain number at a time) - again, somehow limited
 
 - this fits better in a framework where you can fight the same enemy more than once
	- so you have a few lives, or ways to regain a life
	- also, it works better if you have a way to learn some information about the fight ahead of time, to see if you can match your cards and items to it


StS starts you off with a deck of BAD cards, so your goal is not only to learn better cards/spells but also to UNlearn your initial/bad cards/spells


I kinda like BL2's elements and how they interact with each other and different enemy types
 - you could also have destructible shields
 
 - similarly to ER, different enemies and bosses should have different weaknesses


you could have unwilling minions, where if you kill, injure or stun the owner the minion will turn against them (and you, but later)


consumables?

items affect both card aspect and bullet hell aspect


you should be able to draw cards outside of combat, if you want to interact with traps, secrets, environment

Levels don't have to be very linear - they can repeat, rooms can be revisited, you can chase enemies through them...
	you like exploration and affecting a change on the world, see if this can be relevant here
	
	factions could be interesting - not everyone against you but some fight each other (or are capable of this, if you lure them/wake them/etc.)


		
so you have layers of game knowledge:
  movement and aiming
  enemy/boss knowledge
  card tactics
  deck/item build strategy


good opportunity to build systems :)
	factions and "charming"
	stealth
	traps/lures
	boss limb breaks


card thoughts:
 - Slay the Spire
 - Enter the Gungeon
 - Worms
 - Brotato
 - Hellcard
 - Faeria
 - MTG
 - Gwent
 - <any other card game>
 
 - a fireball that you detonate on click
 - magical traps that hurt or slow down enemies (glyphs, roots)
 - a Blind spell that makes the enemy's aim random for a while
 - a large AoE (fire storm?)
 - 
 
 

	
MVP:
 - movement + firing guns + several guns
	- you can use particle effects and occluder in PadLib
	
 - cards UI + turns/draws + different kinds of animation
	- several different kinds of cards
 - level(s)	
	- with some way to know the kinds of rooms you're getting, so that you don't always traverse most/all of the dungeon like in EtG
 - enemies
 - boss or two
	- a single big one
		- has AoE that gets weaker the more you damage it between AoE casts
		- a meteor attack that has marks on the floor you need to avoid
		
	- a duo that you have to zigzag between (with one being aggressive and one being passive, and then they switch)


 - NOW MAKE IT INTERESTING
	- combos between cards, items
	- changing levels
	- enemies of enemies (i.e. several factions)
