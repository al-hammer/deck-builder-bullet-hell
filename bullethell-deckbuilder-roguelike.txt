
consider pace of play: EtG/bullet hell is very fast paced, StS/turn-based cards are as slow as you want them to be
 - if this were a cover-based shooter it would have a more natural flow with stops for taking cover, reloading, going between covers, etc.
 - this means that:
	- rooms need more cover, including ways to create cover via cards
	- enemies need ways to deal with cover:
		- ways to efficiently destroy cover
		- ways to maneuver around cover
	- it also makes sense to have enemies act in "turns"
		- let's say the enemy does a large AoE each end of turn, but it also shoots bullets during the turn, so you can prepare for the AoE while dodging the bullets



card-based roguelike bullet hell, AKA Enter The Gungeon meets Slay the Spire?

you can slow down/pause the game to play a card (and if you slow down you MUST play a card or draw another hand)

drawing a hand of cards takes time (an animation)

cards translate into attacks, defenses, structures, weapons, temporary buffs or debuffs
	think: barricades, turrets, traps, lures, etc.

	some cards are instants, some require an animation, some require animation AND slow you down, or force you to stand
		obvious move: have a card that makes the next card you play an instant, or rather speeds it up by one (instant -- animation -- slow-moving animation -- standing animation)
		item that buffs slow and standing animations?
		
	
	there should be some energy mechanism similar to StS
		should recharge fully when you shuffle your hand
		should recharge slowly when you don't shuffle
			recharge speed is a variable too
		
		initially capped at 3, can be increased, StS-style
	
	you start with 2 weapon slots, can increase/decrease with items
	
	each end of combat you lose your weapons 
	
consumables?

items affect both card aspect and bullet hell aspect
		
so you have layers of game knowledge:
  movement and aiming
  enemy/boss knowledge
  card tactics
  deck/item build strategy


good opportunity to build systems :)
	factions and "charming"
	stealth
	traps/lures
	boss limb breaks
	
	
MVP:
 - movement + firing guns + several guns
	- you can use particle effects and occluder in PadLib
	
 - cards UI + turns/draws + different kinds of animation
	- several different kinds of cards
 - level(s)	
	- with some way to know the kinds of rooms you're getting, so that you don't always traverse most/all of the dungeon like in EtG
 - enemies
 - boss or two
	- a single big one
	- a duo that you have to zigzag between (with one being aggressive and one being passive, and then they switch)
